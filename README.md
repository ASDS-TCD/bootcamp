# Pre-Semester Math and Code Bootcamp (Trinity College Dublin, September 2021)

This is the central repository for the pre-semester math and code bootcamp for incoming students of: 
- Postgraduate Diploma in Applied Social Data Science at Trinity College Dublin  
- PhD in Political Science at Trinity College Dublin  
- PhD in Political Science at University College Dublin

The over-arching goals of this week's bootcamp are to: 
- Translate social (political) phenomena into mathematical notation
- Translate mathematical notation into R
      
To achieve these goals, we'll concentrate on these topics through out our week together:

1. Sets, Statements, and Proof: 
	- defining and operating on sets; 
	- understanding relationships between sets;
	- properties of some important sets;
	- what are mathematical statements; 
	- combining statements; 
	- establishing truth or falsehood; 
	- implications, quantifiers, logical operations, and contrapositives;
	- prove properties of binary relations and orders, preferences, and choices
	
2.  Functions and Graphs: 
	- introduce idea of a function; 
	- some important functions; 
	- plot functions and interpret graphs;
	- calculate and simulate to find marginal, conditional, and posterior probs; 
	- identify and apply the distributional functions of discrete and continous random vars;
	- calculate expectations, variances, covariances, other moments of random vars
	
3. Calculus: 
	- find and prove limits; 
	- calculate and interpret derivatives (in one and several variables);
	- find minima, maxima, and inflection/saddle points of functions (in one and several variables)
	- calculate and interpret integrals (in one and several variables)
	
4. Algebra (Linear): 
	- working with equalities and inequalities; 
	- giving particular attention to exponents, logarithms, summations, products; 
	- perform vector and matrix arithmetic
